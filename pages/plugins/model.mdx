# Model

If you needed to create a custom database model for your plugin, you can do so by creating a mongoose schema and then using it to create a model.
Here is an example of how you can create a model for a simple plugin:

```ts filename="src/server/model.ts"
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
  },
});

export const User = mongoose.model('User', schema);
```

In this example, we are creating a model called `User` with two fields: `name` and `age`. Both fields are required.

Now, inside out plugin, we can use this model to interact with the database:

```ts filename="src/server/server.ts"
import { User } from './model';

export class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  rpc = getRPC(this);
  displayName = 'MyPlugin';
  ...
}

type CreateUserInput = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
const getRPC = (plugin: Plugin) => ({
  createUser: async ({ input }: CreateUserInput) => {
    const user = new User({ name: input.name, age: input.age });
    await user.save();
  },
});
```

The `createUser` method in the `getRPC` function creates a new `User` instance and saves it to the database.
This RPC method can be called from the [client](client-api#usepluginrpcmutation) interface to create a new user in the database.
