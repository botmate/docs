# Server API

The Server API is used to define the backend logic of the plugin. It
contains functions that interact with the database, external APIs, or
other services. The server API is defined in the `server.ts` file of the
plugin. Similar to the [Client API](client-api), the Server API also consists of
lifecycle functions, custom hooks, and variables.

A Server API consists of the following:

- an entry point which is `server.ts`
- lifecycle functions
- and several methods to interact with the server

## Entry file

The entry file for the Server API is `[plugin-name]/src/server/server.ts`.

## Lifecycle functions

### beforeLoad

This function runs every time the plugin is about to load. It usually
includes tasks like setting up the database connection or initializing
external services. It is required to register hooks in the `beforeLoad`
function.

### load

This function runs after all the `beforeLoad` functions have finished. It
can include logic that depends on other plugins being enabled. A plugin
can invoke other plugins' hooks in the `load` function.

## Available methods

The Server API provides plugins with access to various methods for
performing actions. Refer to this table for details:

### registerHook

The `registerHook` method is used to register a new hook that can be
invoked by other plugins. It takes two parameters: the name of the hook
and a callback function that will be executed when the hook is invoked.

**Example:**

```ts
this.registerHook('onMessageReceived', (message) => {
  console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);
});
```

The above example registers a new hook called `onMessageReceived` that
logs the received message to the console.

### invokeHook

The `invokeHook` method is used to invoke a hook that has been registered
by another plugin. It takes the name of the hook and any additional
arguments that should be passed to the hook.

**Example:**

```ts
this.invokeHook('onMessageReceived', 'Hello, world!');
```

The above example invokes the `onMessageReceived` hook with the message
`Hello, world!`.

### sendClientMessage

The `sendClientMessage` method is used to send a message to the client
interface. It takes two parameters: the message to send and the type of
message (either `'info'` or `'error'`).

**Example:**

```ts
this.sendClientMessage('An error occurred', 'error');
```

The above example sends an error message to the client interface.

### configManager

The `configManager` method is used to interact with the plugin's
configuration settings. It returns an object with `get` and `set`
methods for getting and setting configuration values.

**Example:**

```ts
const config = this.configManager<Config>();
const value = await config.get('myConfigKey');

await config.set('myConfigKey', 'myConfigValue');
```

The above example retrieves the value of a configuration key and sets a
new value for the key.

## RPC

The Server API can also define an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface that
can be called from the client interface. The RPCs are defined in an object
that contains methods that can be called remotely.

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** RPC only accepts parameters in the form of a single object, i.e.
  only first argument can be passed.
</Callout>

Here is an example of an implementation of the Server API:

```ts filename="src/server/server.ts" showLineNumbers
import { repository } from '@botmate/platform-telegram';
import { PlatformType, Plugin } from '@botmate/server';

export class Analytics extends Plugin {
  rpc = getRPC(this);
  displayName = 'PluginA';
  platformType = PlatformType.Telegram;

  beforeLoad() {
    // Register a hook to get the user count
    this.registerHook('analytics/get-user-count', (message) => {
      return repository.getUserCount();
    });
  }
}

const getRPC = (plugin: Plugin) => ({
  getTelegramChats: async (pageNo: number) => {
    const chats = await repository.getChats(pageNo);
    return chats.map((chat) => chat.toObject());
  },
});

export type RPC = ReturnType<typeof getRPC>;
```

In this example, the `Analytics` plugin defines a `getRPC` function that
returns an object with a `getTelegramChats` method. The `getTelegramChats`
method fetches chats from the Telegram repository and returns them as an
array of objects. The `beforeLoad` function registers a hook that can be
invoked by other plugins to get the user count.

Example of invoking the hook in another plugin:

```ts filename="src/server/server.ts" showLineNumbers
export class AnotherPlugin extends Plugin {
  rpc = getRPC(this);
  displayName = 'Another Plugin';
  platformType = PlatformType.Telegram;

  async load() {
    const userCount = await this.invokeHook<number>('analytics/get-user-count');
    console.log(`User count: ${userCount}`);
  }
}
```
