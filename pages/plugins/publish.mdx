# Publishing

Once you have developed a plugin and tested it locally, you can publish it to the NPM registry for others to install and use.
We recommend publishing your plugin to the public NPM registry to make it available to the community.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v6.14.1 or higher)
- [npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup)

## Step 1: Prepare your plugin

After you have developed and tested your plugin locally, you need to prepare it for publishing.

1. **Update the version**: Update the version number in the `package.json` file.
2. **Build the plugin**: Run the build command to generate the production build of your plugin.

Make sure you have set `platformType` in `package.json` to match the platform you are building for.

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "name": "botmate-plugin-example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "lib/server/index.js",
  "botmate": {
    "platformType": "telegram"
  }
}
```

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Step 2: Publish your plugin

Once you have prepared your plugin, you can publish it to the NPM registry.

1. **Login to NPM**: Run the following command to login to your NPM account.

```bash
npm login
```

2. **Publish the plugin**: Run the following command to publish your plugin to the NPM registry.

```bash
npm publish
```

## Step 3: Verify the plugin

After publishing your plugin, you can verify it by installing it in a new project.

1. **Create a new project**: Create a new project and install your plugin using the following command.

```bash
npm install [plugin-name]
```

2. **Verify the installation**: Verify that your plugin is installed correctly and working as expected.

## Step 4: Share your plugin

Once you have verified your plugin, you can share it on our [marketplace](https://market.botmate.dev).
