# Publishing

Once you have developed a plugin and tested it locally, you can publish it to the NPM registry for others to install and use.
We recommend publishing your plugin to the public NPM registry to make it available to the community.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v6.14.1 or higher)

Coming soon...
