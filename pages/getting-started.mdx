# Getting Started

### Project setup

To create a new project, run:

```bash
npx create-botmate
# OR
pnpm create botmate
```

A new directory will be created with the name "**botmate**". Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```bash
cd botmate
npm start
# OR
pnpm start
```

Note: By default, the project will come with Telegram plugin pre-installed.

### Start BotMate

BotMate uses MongoDB as its database. So, make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine.

Next, create a new file named **.env** in the root directory of the project. Add the following environment variables to the file:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<your_mongo_uri>
```

To start BotMate, run:

```bash
npm start
# OR
pnpm start
```
