# Adding first bot

Now that you have successfully setup BotMate, let's add your first bot. You should
be presented with a login screen. If you are opening for the first time, you will
be asked to login with username and password. By default, the username is `admin`
and password is `admin`. Next, you will be redirected to bots management page. From here, you can add a new bot.

your bot messaging platform and enter the token.
