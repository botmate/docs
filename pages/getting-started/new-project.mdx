# New Project

<Callout emoji='ðŸ‘¾'>
	**Note:** BotMate is still in development and is not ready for production use.
</Callout>

In this guide, we will learn how to create a new BotMate project and start it.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.17.0 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (v4.4.6 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v6.14.1 or higher) (recommended)

Note: _We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. It is faster than npm and uses less disk space._

To get a free MongoDB instance, you can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
It provides a free tier with **512** MB storage and 2 GB bandwidth, which is more than enough for most projects.

## Project setup

To create a new project, run:

```bash
pnpm create botmate
```

A new directory will be created with the name "**botmate**". Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```bash
cd botmate
pnpm build
```

Note: By default, the project will come with Telegram plugin pre-installed.

Learn why build is required [here](/plugins-development/introduction).

## Start BotMate

BotMate uses MongoDB as its database. So, make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine.

Next, create a new file named **.env** in the root directory of the project. Add the following environment variables to the file:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<your_mongo_uri>
```

To start BotMate, run:

```bash
pnpm start
```
