# Installation

In this guide, we will learn how to setup on your local machine.
All the data are stoed in local SQLite database. You do not need to setup any external database,
wich makes it easier to get started.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v6.14.1 or higher)
- [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (database)

<Callout type="info">
  If you want a free MongoDB database, you can use
  [MongoDB
  Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
</Callout>

## CLI

Use the following commands to setup BotMate on your machine:

```sh
pnpm create botmate
```

This command will prompt you to specify a folder name (default is "botmate") to initialize a new BotMate project.
Subsequently, you will be asked to select your preferred messaging platform.
The created folder contains several files and directories; understanding their structure will enhance your ability to work with BotMate, including plugin development.

  src="/images/botmate-cli-01.png"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
/>

Next, change your working directory to the project's folder and run pnpm install to install the required dependencies to start BotMate.

Next, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/botmate
```

Now the dependencies are installed, run pnpm dev to start a development server on port 8233.
You will be presented with a setup screen, which asks you to select a message platform. Select your bot's messaging platform and enter the require input fields and click submit.

After the setup you should be presented with the dashboard interface.

## Repository

You can also clone the BotMate repository and setup the project manually. This method is recommended for developers who want to contribute to the project.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/botmate/botmate
cd botmate
```

After cloning the repository, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/botmate
```

Then, install the dependencies and run the development server.

### Run development server

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the BotMate development server on port 8233. Visit (http://localhost:8233) to access the dashboard.

## Docker (Coming soon)

Docker support is coming soon. Stay tuned for updates.
