  **Note:** BotMate is still in development, and
  we are working hard to make it stable.

In this guide, we will learn how to setup on your local machine.
All the data are stoed in local SQLite database. You do not need to setup any external database,
wich makes it easier to get started.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v6.14.1 or higher) (recommended)

Note: _We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. It is faster than npm and uses less disk space._

There are several ways to create a new BotMate project:

## Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with BotMate is to use Docker. You can use the following command to create a new BotMate project:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/data botmate/botmate:latest
```

This command download the latest BotMate image and run it on port 3000.
A new **SQLite** database will be created in the `data` directory.

## Manual Installation

You can also install BotMate manually by cloning the repository:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/botmate/botmate
cd botmate
pnpm install
```

### Build the Project

```bash
mkdir data
pnpm run db:push
pnpm run build
```

This will clone the BotMate repository, install the dependencies, push the database schema, and build the project.

### Running the Project

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will start the BotMate server on port 3000.
